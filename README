Chronodot Library for the Arduino IDE

This library provides the usual Real Time Clock (RTC) functions from the original
RTClib (courtesy of Adafruit) from which it was derrived. It adds the ability
to read out the temperature as sensed by the Chronodot's internal temperature
sensor. The readings are available in both celcius and farenheit.

Examples are provided.

Cheers!
